    <p class="game-description">
        Welcome to the Bingo Game! Your goal is to match characteristics of people 
        in a 3x3 bingo board. Below each characteristic, you can write a name 
        and a fun fact to connect it to someone you know. 
        Click on a cell to mark it when you've completed it. The challenge: get three in a row, column, or diagonal!
